# Wiki Module

This module allows an authorized user to create wiki pages which include title and content. Content can contain HTML formatting, links, and images. The module utilizes standard wiki syntax to enable authors to use [[Title]] tags to create new wiki pages which are automatically linked to the current page using standard hyperlinks. All versions of wiki content are retained for historical reference, allowing review and rollback to previous versions if necessary. The module has search functionality so that users can easily locate a specific wiki page by keyword. It also has the ability to specify tags for wiki pages to provide flexible categorization of content. The module automatically keeps track of the links between wiki pages for seamless navigation. It supports site maps so that wiki pages are discoverable by search engines. An RSS feed is also available for simple content syndication.
